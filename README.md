This asset comes packaged with the NDS prefab.
Drag it into the scene and hit play.

There are a few buttons to play around with.

Within the inspector there are many parameters:

 - StreetPass
 - SpotPass
 - Low Battery
 - Flip Speed
 - Spin Speed
 - Close Amount
 - Screen Brightness
 - Alternative Scroll Rect Content
 
 Many of these settings may be available within Game Mode as well.
 
 If you'd like to use this in your game (like Luigi's Mansion!), just
 drag the prefab in, and modify the scroll rect content to match that of your game's needs.
